1. In the topics: Map elements, Body elements, and Prolog elements, though the list items can be listed using <li> in a <ul>, 
I have used <ul> tag intentionally for every list item to create space and appear as is in the Assignment. 

2. Image map is not rendering properly in PDF.

3. In the "Programming elements" topic, I haven't used a few tags in the right way as I'm unsure and couldn't find time to explore more on their usage as I'm occupied with my project deliverables. 
   Please excuse.
